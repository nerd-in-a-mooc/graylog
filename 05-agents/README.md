# ðŸ¦™ Agents

Agents are small applications made to ship logs from the nodes to graylog.

We tried almost all of them, but we are currently working with two of them.

- [rsyslog](rsyslog/README.md)
- [winglobeat](winlogbeat/README.md)

Most network device don't need no agent. Logs cant be shipped directly since shipping logs from is a build in function.
